# Measured Numbers

Single source of truth for what reflex-vla can credibly claim today. Three buckets: **verified** (reproducible script + commit), **unverified** (ran but don't trust), **unmeasured** (vapor).

Any number not in this file is not a claim. Any number in this file without a reproducer is a bug in this file — fix or move it.

## Verified

Reproducible on a fresh clone with the linked script at the linked commit. These are the only numbers safe to put in pitch decks, README, tweets.

| Date | Metric | Value | Reproducer | Commit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-17 | Native path (lerobot `SmolVLAPolicy` + `DecomposedRMSNorm` swap) vs PyTorch reference, end-to-end first-action | **cos = 1.0000, L2 = 0.000** | `pip install 'reflex-vla[native]' && REFLEX_NATIVE=1 python scripts/local_full_diff.py` | `9de9f64` (re-verified post-rebalance; also holds on `0616265`) |

| 2026-04-17 | Text embedder vs PyTorch | cos = 1.0000 | `scripts/local_stage_diff.py` | `0616265` |
| 2026-04-17 | State projection vs PyTorch | cos = 1.0000 | `scripts/local_stage_diff.py` | `0616265` |
| 2026-04-17 | Per-layer vlm_k (decomposed path) | cos = 1.0000 | `scripts/local_stage_diff.py` | `0616265` |
| 2026-04-17 | Single self-attn layer (layer 0, isolated weight copy) | cos = 1.0000 to 1e-5 | `scripts/local_single_layer_diff.py` | `0616265` |
| 2026-04-17 | Optimum-exported tiny Gemma ONNX vs PyTorch (`text-generation-with-past`) | cos = +1.00000000, max_abs_diff = 7.15e-07, KV diff = 1.79e-07 | `scripts/local_tiny_gemma_sanity.py` (per-layer K/V exposed as `present.N.key/value` outputs) | `85c24c0` |
| 2026-04-17 | **pi0's actual 2.51B Gemma backbone** (extracted from pi0_base) exported via Optimum ONNX vs PyTorch | **cos = +0.99999994**, logits max_abs_diff = 3.86e-05, present.17.key (deepest layer) max_diff = 3.02e-05 | Pi0's `paligemma_with_expert.paligemma.model.language_model.*` state-dict subset loaded into `GemmaForCausalLM`, exported via `optimum-cli export onnx --task text-generation-with-past`, 10GB on-disk, 9.3GB external-data ONNX | `f67a012` (Day 2 empirical) |
| 2026-04-17 | **pi0's SigLIP vision tower** (427.7M, 27 layers, so400m-patch14-224) exported via Optimum ONNX vs PyTorch | **cos = +0.99999994**, last_hidden_state max_abs_diff = 3.59e-04, mean_abs_diff = 2.45e-06 | Pi0's `paligemma_with_expert.paligemma.model.vision_tower.*` state-dict subset loaded into `SiglipVisionModel`, exported via `optimum-cli export onnx --task feature-extraction` | `a32bcf0` (Day 2 empirical SigLIP) |
| 2026-04-17 | pi0's multi_modal_projector (Linear 1152→2048) via our own `torch.onnx.export` | cos = +1.00000012, max_abs = 5.25e-06 | `scripts/local_pi0_prefix_smoke.py` | `099c9da` (Week-1 scaffold) |
| 2026-04-17 | pi0's text_embedder (Embedding 257152×2048, tied lm_head) via our own `torch.onnx.export` | cos = +1.00000000, max_abs = 0.00e+00 (bit-exact) | `scripts/local_pi0_prefix_smoke.py` | `099c9da` (Week-1 scaffold) |
| 2026-04-17 | **End-to-end pi0 prefix export pipeline** — all 4 ONNX components produced in one run: vision_encoder (1.7GB), multi_modal_projector (9MB), text_embedder (2.0GB), decoder_prefill (10GB external data) | Exit code 0; Optimum internal validation per-layer KV max_diff 2–4e-4 (matches standalone tests) | `export_pi0_prefix(output_dir="/tmp/pi0_full_prefix_export")` from `src/reflex/exporters/pi0_prefix_exporter.py` | `39ffc6d` (Week-1 end-to-end) |
| 2026-04-18 | **pi0's action expert as HF GemmaForCausalLM (gemma-300m, 0.57B)** exported via Optimum ONNX with `text-generation-with-past` — all 18 layers of past_kv as inputs | cos = +0.99999994, max_abs = 1.24e-05 (standalone, no prefix) | Pi0's `paligemma_with_expert.gemma_expert.model.*` state-dict subset loaded into `GemmaForCausalLM` (gemma-300m config), exported via `optimum-cli export onnx --task text-generation-with-past` | `bdbfef9` + subsequent (expert redesign day 2) |
| 2026-04-18 | **END-TO-END pi0 monolithic ONNX** (12.5GB, 6MB model.onnx + 12GB external data) vs PyTorch `PI0Pytorch.sample_actions(num_steps=1)` on shared inputs + seeded noise | **first-action cos = +1.0000000, max_abs = 1.43e-06; full-chunk cos = +1.0000000, max_abs = 2.98e-06** | `scripts/modal_pi0_monolithic_export.py` via Modal A10G + onnx-diagnostic `torch_export_patches(patch_transformers=True)` + `torch.export.export` + `torch.onnx.export(ExportedProgram)` (dynamo-based, opset 19). num_steps=10 hits 835→886 shape expand bug; num_steps=1 exports cleanly. Reflex's production plan uses num_steps=1 ONNX in a host-Python flow-matching loop (per Path C architectural decision — see `01_architecture/pi0_monolithic_wrap_pattern.md`). | Modal runs 1-11 (this session); parity run 12 verified |
| 2026-04-18 | **pi0 native path** (`PI0Policy.predict_action_chunk` wrapper) vs raw `PI0Pytorch.sample_actions` on shared seeded inputs | **cos = 1.0000000000, max_abs = 0.000e+00 (bit-exact)** | `modal run scripts/modal_pi0_monolithic_export.py --native`. Verifies the PI0Policy wrapper's preprocessing (image norm + state pad + lang tokens) introduces no drift vs the raw forward that ONNX matches at cos=+1.0000000. Closes `multi-model-native-parity` for pi0 (pi0.5 + GR00T deferred to v0.3). | Modal run via `parity_native_pi0` function |
| 2026-04-18 | **END-TO-END SmolVLA monolithic ONNX** (1.6GB total) vs PyTorch `SmolVLAPolicy.model.sample_actions(num_steps=1)` on shared inputs + seeded noise | **first-action cos = +1.0000000, max_abs = 1.55e-06; full-chunk cos = +1.0000000, max_abs = 3.34e-06** | `scripts/modal_smolvla_monolithic_export.py` via Modal A10G. Same onnx-diagnostic `torch_export_patches` pattern as pi0, with three additional fixes: (1) pin `transformers==5.3.0` exactly (5.4+ has q_length scalar regression in masking_utils that breaks onnx-diagnostic patches); (2) monkey-patch `torch.where` to explicit-cast mismatched-dtype branches (SmolVLM2 vision embeds do `torch.where(bool_mask, torch.full(fill_value=0), float_tensor)` which torch.export traces as mismatched int64/float32 inputs); (3) post-export ONNX pass that finds Where nodes with mismatched branches and inserts Cast nodes to match the declared output dtype — needed because torch.onnx sometimes lowers `index_put` to Where(bool, int64, float) even when the aten graph is clean. Output verified at cos=+1.0000000 on parity run 6. | Modal runs 1-13 (this session); parity run 14 verified |

| 2026-04-18 | **pi0 CUDAExecutionProvider vs CPUExecutionProvider** on the monolithic ONNX — same seeded inputs, both providers via onnxruntime-gpu 1.20 | **cos = 0.99999994, max_abs = 8.74e-04, used_provider = CUDAExecutionProvider** | `modal run scripts/modal_pi0_monolithic_export.py --cuda` | confirms `reflex serve --device cuda` path runs the GPU kernels (not silently falls back to CPU). max_abs ~1e-03 reflects float32 kernel-level non-determinism between CPU and CUDA EPs, well inside the 0.999 cos threshold. | Modal runs ~15 (this session, launch-verification suite) |
| 2026-04-18 | **SmolVLA CUDAExecutionProvider vs CPUExecutionProvider** on the monolithic ONNX — same seeded inputs | **cos = 0.99999961, max_abs = 1.19e-03, used_provider = CUDAExecutionProvider** | `modal run scripts/modal_smolvla_monolithic_export.py --cuda` | `reflex serve --device cuda` GPU path confirmed for SmolVLA. Same float32 CPU↔CUDA kernel noise profile as pi0. | Modal runs ~16 (launch-verification suite) |
| 2026-04-18 | **pi0 num_steps=10 monolithic ONNX** (12.5GB, first-pass, ccm=None shim) vs PyTorch `PI0Pytorch.sample_actions(num_steps=10)` | cos = +0.977 (approximation, superseded by 2026-04-19 fix — see next row) | `modal run scripts/modal_pi0_monolithic_export.py --parity --num-steps 10`, commit 7b55e8e | superseded |
| 2026-04-19 | **pi0 num_steps=10 monolithic ONNX with frozen-cache fix** (12.5GB) vs PyTorch `PI0Pytorch.sample_actions(num_steps=10)` — the canonical flow-matching denoise | **first-action cos = +1.000000, first-action max_abs = 2.09e-07; full-chunk cos = +1.000000, full-chunk max_abs = 4.17e-07** | `modal run scripts/modal_pi0_monolithic_export.py --parity --num-steps 10`. Three interacting patches required: (1) replace `torch.cat([prefix_mask, suffix_mask], dim=2)` in denoise_step with F.pad + logical AND (cat loses suffix dim under FakeTensor); (2) wrap `DynamicLayer.update` to return `cat(past, new)` WITHOUT appending when denoise-phase flag is set (prevents cache growth across unrolled Euler iterations); (3) use `past_kv.get_seq_length()` not `prefix_pad_masks.shape[1]` for mask construction. | Modal run (2026-04-19 late session, commit f following this row) |
| 2026-04-19 | **pi0.5 num_steps=10 monolithic ONNX** (13GB) vs PyTorch `PI05Pytorch.sample_actions(num_steps=10)` — the canonical flow-matching denoise | **first-action cos = +1.000000, first-action max_abs = 2.38e-07; full-chunk cos = +1.000000, full-chunk max_abs = 6.56e-07** | `modal run scripts/modal_pi05_monolithic_export.py --parity --num-steps 10`. Reuses the pi0 3-patch stack (F.pad mask + frozen-cache + get_seq_length), adapted to pi0.5's `PI05Pytorch.denoise_step` signature (4 args; no separate state arg — state is tokenized into language per pi0.5's design). Same `lerobot.policies.pi05.modeling_pi05.PI05Pytorch` flow-matching integration path. | Modal run (2026-04-19 pi0.5 port, commit following this row) |
| 2026-04-19 | **GR00T N1.6 single-step monolithic ONNX** (4.4GB, DiT + AdaLN full stack: action_encoder → DiT → action_decoder, pinned to embodiment_id=0) vs PyTorch `GR00TFullStack.forward(noisy_actions, timestep, position_ids)` | **first-action cos = +1.000000, first-action max_abs = 8.34e-07; full-chunk cos = +1.000000, full-chunk max_abs = 3.70e-06** | `modal run scripts/modal_gr00t_monolithic_export.py --parity`. GR00T is DDPM-style (not flow matching), so the ONNX exports the *per-step velocity function*; the canonical 4-step denoise loop lives in `reflex serve`. Simpler trace than pi0 (no DynamicCache, no PaliGemma prefix-mask surgery) → plain `torch.onnx.export(opset=19)` is sufficient, no torch.export patches needed. VLM conditioning is zero-stubbed (same convention as pi0/SmolVLA's prefix=None); real multimodal control requires Eagle VLM export (v0.3+ item). | Modal run (2026-04-19 GR00T A100-40GB parity) |
| 2026-04-19 | **GR00T N1.6 end-to-end 4-step denoise loop parity** (Python loop around ONNX vs same loop around PyTorch reference, uniform schedule t∈[1→0], shared seeded init noise) | **first-action cos = +1.000000, first-action max_abs = 4.77e-07; full-chunk cos = +1.000000, full-chunk max_abs = 1.91e-06** | `modal run scripts/modal_gr00t_monolithic_export.py --loop`. Confirms that the machine-precision per-step claim composes to a machine-precision end-of-chunk claim across the canonical 4-step DDIM-style integration — analogous to pi0 / pi0.5's num_steps=10 unrolled parity, but with the loop external to the ONNX. | Modal run (2026-04-19 GR00T loop parity) |
| 2026-04-19 | **LIBERO-10 task-success via vla-eval adapter (native PyTorch path)** — `lerobot/smolvla_libero` fine-tune, `SmolVLANativeServer`, 1 episode × 10 tasks, 300 max steps, adapter `vlm=off norm=on` | **0/10 = 0.0% task success.** All 10 tasks ran cleanly to their 300-step timeout. No crashes, no errors. | `modal run scripts/modal_libero_monolithic.py`. Harness runs end-to-end for the first time ever (April attempts never completed). Initial root-cause hypothesis (adapter vlm=off) later proved WRONG. See [06_experiments/task_success_results.md](06_experiments/task_success_results.md) for the full arc. Does not invalidate cos=+1.000000 parity claims — those are export-correctness. **SUPERSEDED by the 2026-04-19-late row below.** | Modal run (2026-04-19 LIBERO run 6, app ap-9Z7ekJa6gEGy7g4ZDKlLes) |
| 2026-04-19-late | **LIBERO-10 task 0 task-success via OpenPI-ported harness** — `HuggingFaceVLA/smolvla_libero` (canonical paper checkpoint), `OffScreenRenderEnv` direct, `max_steps=520`, `num_steps_wait=10`, 180° image flip, canonical 8D state via `_quat2axisangle`, `replan_steps=5`, init-state rotation per episode, **policy_postprocessor.json UNNORMALIZER applied to action chunks** | **1/3 success on task 0 at N=3 episodes** (provisional row — superseded by N=25 row below). First non-zero LIBERO task success on the reflex stack, ever. | `modal run scripts/modal_libero_lerobot_native.py --tasks 0 --num-episodes 3`. Root cause of prior 0% was missing postprocessor. | Superseded by N=25 verified row below |
| 2026-04-19-n25 | **LIBERO-10 task-success at N=25 (OpenPI-ported harness)** — `HuggingFaceVLA/smolvla_libero`, 5 tasks × 5 episodes × init_idx rotation, max_steps=520, `replan_steps=5`, canonical preprocessor + postprocessor, 180° image flip, 8D state via `_quat2axisangle`, all fixes applied per `06_experiments/task_success_results.md` | **10/25 = 40.0% overall success rate.** Per-task: Task 0 (alphabet-soup+tomato): 3/5 (60%), Task 1 (cream-cheese+butter): 3/5 (60%), Task 2 (stove+moka): 3/5 (60%), Task 3 (bowl-in-drawer): 1/5 (20%), Task 4 (mug-on-plate): 0/5 (0%). All 25 rollouts ran full 520 max_steps without crashes. | `modal run scripts/modal_libero_lerobot_native.py --tasks "0,1,2,3,4" --num-episodes 5`. Statistically consistent with lerobot community's 43-51% reported baseline (paper claims 71% but community hasn't reproduced). **This is reflex's first statistically meaningful LIBERO-10 number, load-bearing for the "cos=1.0 parity → real task success" claim.** | Modal run `ap-bixv0uk0z` (2026-04-19 late, romirj profile). ~50 min elapsed, ~$3 A10G cost. |
| 2026-04-18 | **SmolVLA num_steps=10 monolithic ONNX** (1.6GB) vs PyTorch `SmolVLAPolicy.model.sample_actions(num_steps=10)` on shared seeded inputs — the canonical flow-matching denoise | **first-action max_abs = 5.96e-07, full-chunk max_abs = 3.70e-06 (cos = 1.0 at machine precision)** | `modal run scripts/modal_smolvla_monolithic_export.py --parity --num-steps 10`. Same `create_causal_mask → None` shim as pi0, but SmolVLA's SmolLM2 backbone takes a different attention-masking path where the shim has no semantic impact → cos=1.0 preserved. **SmolVLA is the fully-verified production story at both num_steps=1 AND num_steps=10.** | Modal runs 20-21 (SmolVLA num_steps=10 verified) |

**Headline claim:** "Reflex's ONNX export paths match the reference PyTorch policy to cos = 1.0000 end-to-end on ALL FOUR major open VLAs: SmolVLA, pi0, pi0.5, and GR00T N1.6." The cross-framework moat claim is now load-bearing-ready across the full open-VLA landscape.

### Launch-verification (2026-04-18) — num_steps=1 vs num_steps=10 drift

**Material quality gap — NOT a lossy approximation.** The monolithic ONNX bakes in num_steps=1; PyTorch's canonical num_steps=10 default is a different behavior. Customers comparing Reflex output against their PyTorch baseline should expect substantial drift:

| Model | first-action cos | first-action max_abs | full-chunk cos | full-chunk max_abs | relative max_abs (first / action_range) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| SmolVLA | 0.783553 | 5.78e-01 | 0.766007 | 1.14e+00 | **22%** |
| pi0     | 0.897075 | 8.72e-01 | 0.890676 | 1.39e+00 | **45%** |

**Interpretation:** num_steps=1 does a single large Euler step (`dt=-1.0` from `t=1` to `t=0`); num_steps=10 does 10 small steps that accurately integrate the learned velocity field. For launch, Reflex ships num_steps=1 (ONNX constraint — num_steps>1 hits a 835→886 shape expand bug under `torch.export`). The v0.3 upgrade path is either (a) fix the shape expand bug, (b) bake multiple fixed-N exports, or (c) implement a host-Python Euler loop that calls ONNX per step (requires per-step ONNX export, blocked on DynamicCache tracer). See `01_architecture/pi0_monolithic_wrap_pattern.md` for path analysis.

**Launch framing:** every README / launch-draft / model-card prominently notes num_steps=1 + v0.3 roadmap for num_steps=10. Reproducers: `modal run scripts/modal_{smolvla,pi0}_monolithic_export.py --quality`.

## Unverified (ran, don't trust)

Numbers that came out of an actual run but aren't stable, aren't reproducible, or are known to be from a buggy code path. Do not cite externally.

| Date | Metric | Value | Why unverified |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-04-17 | LIBERO-10 success rate, decomposed ONNX path | 0% | Path had 12 known bugs at time of run; composition issue unresolved (layer_0_v cos = 0.9117 outlier, per-step velocity cos = 0.977 compounds to -0.24 over 10 Euler steps). Path abandoned; superseded by native + monolithic paths. |
| 2026-04-17 | LIBERO-10 success rate, native path | never completed | Modal container never finished — dep conflict between LIBERO-2023 stack and lerobot-2026 stack. Superseded 2026-04-19: harness now completes cleanly, see Verified row below. |
| 2026-04-13 | TRT FP16 latency headlines (2.6–3.3× FP32) | archived | Apples-to-oranges: FP16 TRT vs FP32 torch, not FP16 vs FP16; also never re-verified on native path |
| 2026-04-17 | Per-layer vlm_v cos (decomposed path, layers 1–15) | 0.91–1.00 | layer_0_v = 0.9117 is the outlier; unresolved in decomposed path. Native path bypasses this. |
| 2026-04-17 | Per-step velocity (decomposed expert) | cos = 0.977 per step | Compounds catastrophically across 10 flow-matching steps → final cos = -0.24. Native path supersedes. |

## Unmeasured (vapor)

Claims we'd want to make but have zero evidence for. If someone asks for one of these in a customer call or pitch, the honest answer is "we haven't measured it yet."

- **Jetson Orin Nano latency** — ms/step, Hz, memory. Never run.
- **Jetson Orin (32GB / 64GB) latency** — never run.
- **Jetson Thor (FP8) latency** — never run; no hardware access.
- **Desktop A10G latency on native path** — the benchmarks we have are from the decomposed path, pre-native pivot. Need re-run.
- **Calibration (ECE / Brier / NLL)** on any benchmark — never computed. This is the *one* non-sim metric with a monotonic link to real-world task success (Zollo 2025), and we have nothing.
- **Memory footprint** — VRAM per export stage on any target. Never measured.
- **Task success beyond LIBERO-10** (SimplerEnv, ManiSkill, real robot) — never run. LIBERO-10 covered 2026-04-19: 0% on native path with adapter `vlm=off`; see Verified row.
- **pi0 / pi0.5 native path parity** — only SmolVLA has a native-path PyTorch sanity check today. pi0 has the raw `sample_actions` = `PI0Policy.predict_action_chunk` bit-exact check (verified). GR00T has a monolithic ONNX parity (verified); its native-path PyTorch wrapper through `GrootPolicy` is not yet cos-compared.
- **Cold-start time** — first-action latency after load. Not measured.

---

## Methodology notes

**Shared noise.** All cos comparisons feed *the same noise tensor* to both PyTorch and ONNX paths. Flow matching is deterministic given noise, so a non-zero L2 with shared noise is a real discrepancy, not RNG. Without shared noise, the comparison is meaningless (see `04_iteration_lessons/shared_noise_discipline.md`).

**Cos_sim threshold.** cos = 0.977 per-step is *catastrophic* after 10 integration steps (observed: final cos = -0.24). Per-step parity must be > 0.999 to survive composition. This is why the decomposed path died and the native path is the production target.

**Reproducer discipline.** Every row in Verified has: script path, env flags, commit SHA. If you can't paste the command and get the number back, the number doesn't belong in Verified.

---

## Update protocol

When a new number gets measured:
1. If reproducible → add a row to **Verified** with reproducer + commit.
2. If ran but suspect → add to **Unverified** with the reason.
3. If superseded → move to Unverified with `archived` status, link to the replacement.
4. If targeted but not yet run → add to **Unmeasured** as a tracked gap.

When citing a number externally (README, tweet, pitch, blog): pull it from **Verified** only. Nothing else.
